# Description
This application will calculate the age of a person on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Once the age has been calculated, life expectancy on Earth will be calculated and then translated to life expectancy on the previously mentioned four planets. Life expectancy is calculated based on the following factors:  
  
1. What type of climate they live in
2. How many calories they consume per day
3. Preference for the beach or for the forest
